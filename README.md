Project Title
Student Marks Histogram

Problem Statement
Understanding the distribution of student marks in a class is essential for evaluating performance, identifying learning gaps, and recognizing achievement patterns. Raw marks alone do not provide meaningful insights unless they are grouped and visualized effectively.

Objective / Question
How can we create a Python visualization that displays the distribution of student marks using a histogram?

Summary
This project involves creating a histogram using Matplotlib in Python to visualize how student marks are distributed across defined ranges. This graphical representation helps educators and students interpret performance levels more clearly.

Description
Collect or load a list of student marks.

Use Pandas or Python lists to store the marks.

Use Matplotlibâ€™s plt.hist() to create the histogram.

Set appropriate bin ranges (e.g., 0â€“10, 11â€“20, ..., 91â€“100).

Add X-axis and Y-axis labels, title, and grid lines.

Optionally, save the chart as an image for reports.

Functional Components
Input: List of student marks.

Processing: Use plt.hist() for plotting.

Configuration: Define bins for score ranges.

Output: Histogram showing number of students per range.

Example Output

Edit
Marks Range (X-axis) â†’ Number of Students (Y-axis)
The histogram will clearly display the frequency of students scoring in each marks range.
