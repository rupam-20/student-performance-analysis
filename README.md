Student Marks Histogram


📌 Project Overview


This project visualizes the distribution of student marks using a histogram in Python.
By grouping marks into defined ranges, it helps educators and students understand performance trends, identify learning gaps, and highlight achievement patterns.

🎯 Problem Statement


Raw student marks alone don’t provide deep insights into performance.
To evaluate results effectively, marks need to be grouped and visualized in a meaningful way.

Key Question:
How can we create a Python visualization that displays the distribution of student marks using a histogram?

🛠️ Features


Load marks data from a CSV file or list

Group marks into bins (e.g., 0–10, 11–20, ..., 91–100)

Generate a histogram using Matplotlib

Add axis labels, title, and grid for better readability

Save the chart as an image file

📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is StudentsPerformance.csv, which contains student marks in multiple subjects.
For this project, the "math score" column is used.

📜 Requirements


Make sure you have the following installed:


pip install pandas matplotlib


🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-marks-histogram.git
cd student-marks-histogram
Place your CSV file (StudentsPerformance (1).csv) in the project folder.

Run the Python script:

python student_marks_histogram.py
View the generated histogram and saved image (student_marks_histogram.png).

📊 Example Output

📈 Functional Components

Input: List or dataset of student marks

Processing: Group marks into defined bins using plt.hist()

Output: Histogram showing the distribution of marks
